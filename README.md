# Genetic-Algorithm
A simplistic genetic algorithm to optimize functions having n variables!

Input the function required to be optimized as shown in the file. Change the number of variables based on the function and choose to find the maximum or minimum. Write the variables in the form x[0], x[1], x[2] and so on for your variables in the 'function'. A common bound for the variables can be provided. All information regarding the same has been commented in the notebook. Have fun optimizing!

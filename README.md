# Genetic-Algorithm
A simplistic genetic algorithm to optimize functions having n variables!

Input the function required to be optimized as shown in the file. Change the number of variables based on the function and choose to find the maximum or minimum. A common bound for the variables can be provided. All information regarding the same has been commented in the notebook. Have fun optimizing!
